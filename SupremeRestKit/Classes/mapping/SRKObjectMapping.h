/**
 SRKObjectMapping objects using to map dictionary to given object `DSObject`
 
 you able to create mapping objects in two ways:
 
 i.  create Mapping with properties from array/dictionary
 ii. as Mapping that extends other mapping. In this case you need to provide mapping name that already in a current mapping scope, or will be there before request (see -addMapping:withName: in `SRKMappingScope`)
 
 Couple things that you should knew:
 
 - !!! if you want that object will be unique you need to add maping for objectId property which is basic for any `DSObject` subclass and DSObject itself
 
 - if you want to map to the specific object class you should specify a className property
 - if you doesnt want to create a class but wanna still have a unique object specify storageName to make sure object will be saved in specific storage
 

 - You also able to map objectId using objectIdentifierKeyPath ex:{"title","...","id":1} in this case all what you need to do is to set objectIdentifierKeyPath = "id"
 - you able to provide keyPath for a specific mapping in data ex: {"title","...","user":{"id","1","name":"alex","address":{"city":"New York"}}} , keypath for address is "user.address"
 - in case if u need to provide permanent (static) properties you able to use -addPermanentProperty


 
 @note all objects WITH MAPPED OBJECTID OR SPECIFIED objectIdentifierKeyPath will be saved in memmory and autoreleased when specific object will not have any strong pointers to it
